How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can use various tools, such as JUnit testing to help ensure that I am writing functional code that does what is intended.  I follow industry standard best practices, as well as approaching writing code with a behaviorial driven design mindset when considering how to write test cases.  I am also vigilant about writing good code and testing it, understanding that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  I also conduct manual code reviews of my own code and have others review it when possible/appropriate as well.  Finally, I stay abreast of new procedures and techniques and abide by the Code of Ethics for Software Engineering.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
This starts with information gathering (aka requirement elicitation) - asking great questions, sharing mockups with the client, rephrasing their ideas back to them to make sure everyone is on the same page.  From there, careful analysis and design to make sure that I am referring back to the needs gathered and truly designing around what they want/need and prioritizing the most high value needs first.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach with the mindset that spending a little more time and allowing for caution and best practices is the ONLY way I want to design software.  A time crunch is not worth sacrificing security, quality, or my ethics.  There will always be situations that cause for a compromise, but compromising too much is a slippery slope that can lead to decisions that release defective products, buggy code, etc.  The end goal has to be a great customer experience, and even if the customer is pushing for a quicker timeline (because we ALL want things faster, now, instant gratification!) - it is my job to help them understand why a slightly delayed timeline that allows for proper testing and time to follow best practices is vital to their overall success.
